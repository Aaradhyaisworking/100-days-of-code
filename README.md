# 100-days-of-code
Following course of Angela Yu titled 100 days of code

Day-1
Today we worked on band name generator. I learned about Python concepts such as printing, input handling, variables, string concatenation, and formatting to create a functional and user-friendly program.it takes input from users and creates a name for the band.

Day-2
Today we worked on Tip calculator project.This project helps in  understanding of f-strings, mathematical operations including PEMDAS( Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction), data types, and type conversion. It takes inputs from user  for bill amount , tip percentage and number of people splitting the bill . it calculates the amount and splits it equally. Once completed, you will have a useful tool to split bills among friends accurately.

Day-3
Today we worked on Treasure island project.Developed a simple Choose Your Own Adventure game using conditional statements.
Learned to handle user input case sensitivity with the lower() function.
Utilized multi-line strings with triple single quotes for ASCII art.
Applied escape characters to include quotes within strings correctly

Day-4 
Today we worked on the game named Rock, Paper ,Scissors.This project explains concepts such as lists, randomization, variables, input handling, and conditional logic. Mapping out the logic with a flow diagram can be helpful. The Rock, Paper, Scissors project involves user input, random computer choice, and logic to determine the winner. Testing and debugging throughout development helps catch errors early and ensures correct program behavior.

Day-5 
Today we worked on Developing a password generator that creates passwords with user-specified counts of letters, symbols, and numbers.
Implemented an Easy Level password generator that produces passwords with characters in sequence.
Utilized Python's random.choice() for selecting random characters and random.shuffle() to randomize the password list.

Day-6
Today we worked on  programming a robot to navigate a maze by following the right edge.
The robot's starting position and facing direction are randomized, requiring a robust algorithm.
The main strategy uses a hierarchy: turn right if possible, else move forward, else turn left.
Edge cases can cause infinite loops; debugging and testing with problem worlds is essential.

Day-7
Imported lists and variables from external modules to organize code and practice modular programming.
Enhanced user experience by providing feedback for repeated guesses and incorrect letters.
Updated the game to display remaining lives and reveal the correct word at the end.
Encouraged further improvements and experimentation with the Hangman game.

Day-8
Imported and printed the Caesar Cipher logo from the art.py file to enhance program presentation.
Implemented logic to preserve non-alphabetical characters such as numbers, symbols, and spaces during encoding and decoding.
Added a while loop to allow the program to restart based on user input, enabling multiple encoding or decoding sessions.
Identified and fixed a crucial bug by moving the shift negation operation outside the for loop to ensure correct decoding behavior.
