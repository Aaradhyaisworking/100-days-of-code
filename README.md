# 100-days-of-code
Following course of Angela Yu titled 100 days of code

Day-1
Band Name Generator Project.
Today we worked on band name generator. I learned about Python concepts such as printing, input handling, variables, string concatenation, and formatting to create a functional and user-friendly program.it takes input from users and creates a name for the band.

Day-2
Project Tip calculator.
Today we worked on Tip calculator project.This project helps in  understanding of f-strings, mathematical operations including PEMDAS( Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction), data types, and type conversion. It takes inputs from user  for bill amount , tip percentage and number of people splitting the bill . it calculates the amount and splits it equally. Once completed, you will have a useful tool to split bills among friends accurately.

Day-3
Treasure Island Project.
Today we worked on Treasure island project.Developed a simple Choose Your Own Adventure game using conditional statements.
Learned to handle user input case sensitivity with the lower() function.
Utilized multi-line strings with triple single quotes for ASCII art.
Applied escape characters to include quotes within strings correctly

Day-4 
Rock Paper Scissors.
Today we worked on the game named Rock, Paper ,Scissors.This project explains concepts such as lists, randomization, variables, input handling, and conditional logic. Mapping out the logic with a flow diagram can be helpful. The Rock, Paper, Scissors project involves user input, random computer choice, and logic to determine the winner. Testing and debugging throughout development helps catch errors early and ensures correct program behavior.

Day-5 
Password Generator.
Today we worked on Developing a password generator that creates passwords with user-specified counts of letters, symbols, and numbers.
Implemented an Easy Level password generator that produces passwords with characters in sequence.
Utilized Python's random.choice() for selecting random characters and random.shuffle() to randomize the password list.

Day-6
Escaping the maze.
Today we worked on  programming a robot to navigate a maze by following the right edge.
The robot's starting position and facing direction are randomized, requiring a robust algorithm.
The main strategy uses a hierarchy: turn right if possible, else move forward, else turn left.
Edge cases can cause infinite loops; debugging and testing with problem worlds is essential.

Day-7
Hangman Project.
Imported lists and variables from external modules to organize code and practice modular programming.
Enhanced user experience by providing feedback for repeated guesses and incorrect letters.
Updated the game to display remaining lives and reveal the correct word at the end.
Encouraged further improvements and experimentation with the Hangman game.

Day-8
Caesar Cipher Project.
Imported and printed the Caesar Cipher logo from the art.py file to enhance program presentation.
Implemented logic to preserve non-alphabetical characters such as numbers, symbols, and spaces during encoding and decoding.
Added a while loop to allow the program to restart based on user input, enabling multiple encoding or decoding sessions.
Identified and fixed a crucial bug by moving the shift negation operation outside the for loop to ensure correct decoding behavior.

Day-9
The Secret Auction Project.
The blind auction program uses a dictionary to store each bidder's name and bid amount.
The screen is cleared between bids by printing multiple new line characters.
The program loops to collect bids until there are no more bidders, then determines the highest bidder.
A function is used to find and print the winner with the highest bid from the dictionary.

Day-10
The Calculator Project.
Built a calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using functions and a dictionary.
Learned to store functions as values in variables and dictionaries, enabling dynamic operation selection.
Implemented user interaction with input prompts, looping, and recursion to allow continuous calculations or starting new ones.
Enhanced the calculator with a logo and formatted output for a professional user experience.

Day-11
Blackjack Capestone Project.
Created a compare() function to determine the game outcome by comparing user and computer scores.
Utilized if, elif, and else statements carefully to handle all game scenarios including Blackjack and draws.
Employed variable renaming to avoid shadowing and improve code clarity using refactoring tools.
Implemented a game loop allowing users to play multiple rounds with console clearing and logo display for a polished user experience.

Day-12
Number Guessing Game.
Printing the starting messages.
Setting the difficulty level based on user input.
Allowing the user to make guesses.
Checking the guess against the randomly selected number.
Choosing a random number between 1 and 100.
Tracking the number of attempts and reducing it after each incorrect guess.
Repeating the guessing process until the user wins or runs out of attempts.
